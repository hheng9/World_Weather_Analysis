# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
### The purpose of this analysis was to call upon application programming interface keys (API) from specific URL requests to gather data from an outside source such as New York times API articles, API weather statistics, or API mapping locations. 

## Results
### By performing Python code through Jupyter notebook we can call on API maps to display images on locations for cities, hotels, countries, temperatures, travel maps, and coordinates. We can convert the API response to JSON format so we can propely filter the information needed as well as define certain parameters. Displayed below is a map of possible travel destination cities with a color coded legend and scatter plots defined by longitude and latitude coordinates.

### We can arrange the data to pinpoint and view specific cities within the same country and attach it to a travel itinerary map as seen below.

## Summary 
### API calls allow data to be filtered and displayed by various categories as needed. We can also size the images, categorize, label, and color code the information and adjust to our liking. The JSON function is compiled with more information than needed which is why we lock into the requested data through the python coding performed.
