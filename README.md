# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
### The purpose of this analysis was to call upon application programming interface keys (API) from specific URL requests to gather data from an outside source such as New York times API articles, API weather statistics, or API mapping locations. 

## Results
### By performing Python code through Jupyter notebook we can call on API maps to display images on locations for cities, hotels, countries, temperatures, travel maps, and coordinates. We can convert the API response to JSON format so we can propely filter the information needed as well as define certain parameters.
